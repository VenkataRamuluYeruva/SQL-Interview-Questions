### 2. **Component Definitions (Example)**

```jsx
// /components/DashboardComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

export function DashboardComponent() {
  return <h2>Dashboard Page</h2>;
}
```

```jsx
// /components/ProfileComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

export function ProfileComponent() {
  return <h2>Profile Page</h2>;

import React from 'react';

export function SettingsComponent() {
  return <h2>Settings Page</h2>;
}
```

### 3. **Dynamic Routing Logic**

Create a file `routing.js` inside the `/utils` directory to handle dynamic component imports and routing setup.

```jsx
// /utils/routing.js
import React from 'react';
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

// Import the components dynamically
import { DashboardComponent } from '../components/DashboardComponent';
import { ProfileComponent } from '../components/ProfileComponent';
import { SettingsComponent } from '../components/SettingsComponent';

// Function to map component name to actual JSX component
export function getComponentByName(componentName) {
  switch (componentName) {
    case 'DashboardComponent':
      return <DashboardComponent />;
    case 'ProfileComponent':
      return <ProfileComponent />;
    case 'SettingsComponent':
      return <SettingsComponent />;
    default:
      return <h2>Component Not Found</h2>;
  }
}

// Sample routes from table data
export const routesFromTable = [
  {
    route_url: '/dashboard',
    routeName: 'Dashboard',
    element: 'DashboardComponent',
    moduleName: 'dashboardModule',
    user: 'admin',
  },
  {
    route_url: '/profile',
    routeName: 'Profile',
    element: 'ProfileComponent',
    moduleName: 'profileModule',
    user: 'admin',
  },
  {
    route_url: '/settings',
    routeName: 'Settings',
    element: 'SettingsComponent',
    moduleName: 'settingsModule',
    user: 'user',
  },
];

// Function to filter routes based on logged-in user type
export function getFilteredRoutes(userType) {
  return routesFromTable.filter(route => route.user === userType);
}

// Create dynamic router with filtered routes
export function createDynamicRouter(filteredRoutes) {
  return createBrowserRouter(
    filteredRoutes.map(route => ({
      path: route.route_url,
      element: getComponentByName(route.element),
    }))
  );
}
```

### 4. **Main Application Entry (`App.jsx`)**

```jsx
// App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
import { getFilteredRoutes, createDynamicRouter } from './utils/routing';

// Simulate logged-in user data (this would typically come from authentication)
const loggedInUser = {
  userId: 1,
  username: 'john_doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  userType: 'admin', // or 'user'
};

// Get filtered routes based on user type
const filteredRoutes = getFilteredRoutes(loggedInUser.userType);

// Create dynamic router using filtered routes
const router = createDynamicRouter(filteredRoutes);

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Dynamic Routing App</h1>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 5. **Entry Point (`index.js`)**

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

# Dynamic Routing in React App (Production Level)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement dynamic routing in a React application, where the routing configuration is based on data (e.g., from a database or an API). The routing setup is conditional based on the user's role (`userType`), and it dynamically loads components based on data from the backend.

The approach allows for flexible, data-driven routing, ideal for applications where routes and permissions are determined at runtime.

## File Structure

```plaintext
/src
  /components
    DashboardComponent.jsx    # Component for Dashboard route
    ProfileComponent.jsx      # Component for Profile route
    SettingsComponent.jsx     # Component for Settings route
  /utils
    routing.js                # Logic for routing and component management
  App.jsx                     # Main app component
  index.js                    # Entry point for the app
  routes.js                   # (Optional) Static route definitions for reference
  README.md                   # Project documentation

## Core Features

### 1. **Dynamic Component Loading**

We use a helper function `getComponentByName()` in `routing.js` to dynamically map route names (stored in a database or table) to actual React components. This allows for flexibility when adding or changing components in the future without modifying the routing configuration.

### 2. **User-Based Routing**

Routing is filtered based on the logged-in user's role (`userType`). This ensures that each user only has access to the routes and pages relevant to them.

In this example:
- `userType: 'admin'` has access to `/dashboard` and `/profile`.
- `userType: 'user'` has access to `/settings`.

This logic can easily be expanded to support more complex role-based access.

### 3. **Dynamic Route Creation**

The app uses `createBrowserRouter` from React Router 6 to create routes dynamically. The routes are created based on data that could come from an API or database, making the routing configuration flexible and extensible.

### 4. **Production-Level Practices**

- **Scalable Routing**: The solution can scale with additional routes, new components, or changes in user roles. Routes are defined in a central configuration (e.g., from a database or an API) and are mapped to components at runtime.
- **Security**: While route filtering happens on the client side, ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place on the backend to restrict access to sensitive routes and data.
- **Performance**: Using `createBrowserRouter` enables React Router 6's optimized handling of routes, including code-splitting and lazy loading.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Lazy Loading**: Components can be lazily loaded using `React.lazy` to improve performance, especially when there are many routes or large components.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Extend the role-based routing by integrating more granular permissions or integrating with an authorization service like OAuth.
- **API Integration**: Instead of static route data in `routing.js`, integrate the routes from a backend API to fetch dynamic routing data for even more flexibility.

### 7. **Detailed Explanation of Key Parts**

#### **Routing Logic (`routing.js`)**
- **`getComponentByName`**: This function maps the string names of components (like `"DashboardComponent"`) to actual imported components. This allows you to dynamically select components based on route configuration from a database.
  
#### **Dynamic Route Creation**
- **`createBrowserRouter`**: React Router v6's new API for creating route configurations. It helps define all routes in a single place and is more scalable and modular than the older `BrowserRouter` and `Route` combinations.
  
#### **User-Specific Route Filtering**
- **`getFilteredRoutes`**: This function filters the routes based on the `userType` (e.g., `admin`, `user`). This ensures that only authorized routes are made available to the user after login.
  
#### **Security Considerations**
- This example demonstrates frontend routing based on the user's type, but you should also enforce role-based access control (RBAC) on the server side for full security. Never rely solely on frontend routing for protecting sensitive data.

### Conclusion

This solution sets up a dynamic and scalable routing system in React that can be easily adapted to any application requiring flexible routes based on user roles. The approach ensures maintainability, security, and performance in a production environment.
