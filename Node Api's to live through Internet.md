If you want to make your API accessible to the public **without using cloud providers** and instead use your **laptop** as the host, you can still follow the same principles, but you will need to configure your local machine and network to allow external access. Here’s how to make your **Node.js API** with **MSSQL** accessible to the public using your **Windows laptop** as the server:

### Steps to Make Your API Public Using Your Laptop

#### 1. **Prepare Your Local Environment**

1. **Ensure Node.js is installed:**
   - Download and install **Node.js** from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.
2. **Install Required Packages:**

   - In your project directory, install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install express mssql jsonwebtoken dotenv body-parser
     ```

3. **Set Up MSSQL Database:**

   - Install **SQL Server Express** or any other version you want. You can download the free SQL Server Express edition from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
   - Set up your database tables for state and district population, similar to the following:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Districts (
       DistrictID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       DistrictName NVARCHAR(100),
       StateName NVARCHAR(100),
       Population INT
     );
     ```

4. **Local API Setup:**
   - Create your Express-based API and set up routes to fetch the state/district data, register, and log in as you described earlier.

#### 2. **Make Your Laptop Accessible Externally**

To allow external access to your laptop, there are a few steps you need to take:

##### 2.1. **Set a Static IP or Use Port Forwarding**

If you're on a **home network** or **local network** (like WiFi), you will need to make your laptop discoverable from the internet. By default, devices on a local network are not directly reachable from the public internet. You have two primary options to expose your API:

1. **Set a Static IP** (Optional):

   - **Optional but Recommended**: Set a static IP address for your laptop on your local network so that the IP does not change over time. This can usually be done from your router settings.

2. **Port Forwarding**:

   - Log in to your router’s admin interface (usually by typing something like `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1` in your browser).
   - Locate the **Port Forwarding** section and set it to forward a specific external port (e.g., 80 or 5000) to the internal port where your API is running (e.g., 5000 for Node.js).
   - Example: Forward port 5000 on the router to port 5000 on your laptop’s local IP address.

   If your IP address is `192.168.1.100`, and your API is running on port `5000`, forward external port `5000` to `192.168.1.100:5000`.

   **Important**: This allows external devices to access your laptop through your router’s public IP address.

##### 2.2. **Get Your Public IP Address**

Once port forwarding is set up, you can find your **public IP address** by:

- **Checking your router’s status page** (usually shows the public IP assigned by your ISP).
- Or, simply search for "What is my IP?" on Google, and it will display the public IP of your router.

This public IP is what external clients will use to access your API. For example, if your public IP is `203.0.113.10`, and you forwarded port `5000`, users would access the API via `http://203.0.113.10:5000/api/districts`.

#### 3. **Allow External Requests on Windows**

On Windows, you need to ensure that the firewall allows traffic on the port you're using (e.g., port 5000). By default, Windows firewall may block inbound connections to your Node.js API.

1. **Open Windows Firewall Settings**:
   - Search for `Windows Defender Firewall` in the Start menu.
   - Click on **Advanced Settings**.
   - In the left pane, click on **Inbound Rules**, then **New Rule**.
2. **Create an Inbound Rule**:

   - Select **Port**, and click **Next**.
   - Choose **TCP**, and enter the port you're using for your API (e.g., 5000).
   - Allow the connection, and follow the prompts to complete the rule.

3. **Test the API Locally**:
   - Before proceeding, test the API locally on your laptop by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/api/districts` to make sure everything is working.

#### 4. **Access the API from the Internet**

Once you've set up port forwarding, your public IP, and allowed external requests, you can now access your API from any device connected to the internet.

1. **Use your public IP address** to access the API:
   - For example, if your public IP is `203.0.113.10`, you can access the API at `http://203.0.113.10:5000/api/districts`.
2. **Test access from another device**:
   - Open a browser or use a tool like **Postman** to test your API by entering the public IP and port.
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to reach your API from a different network (e.g., your mobile data or another WiFi network).

#### 5. **Secure Your API for Public Access**

To make sure your API is secure and production-ready, even though it’s hosted on your laptop:

1. **Use HTTPS**:

   - Although HTTPS is typically set up on cloud platforms, you can use **ngrok** or **Let's Encrypt** to create a secure tunnel. If you're using ngrok, you can easily generate an HTTPS URL for your local development.
   - To use **ngrok**:
     - Download ngrok from [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download).
     - Start ngrok by running:
       ```bash
       ngrok http 5000
       ```
     - It will generate a public HTTPS URL that you can share with others.

2. **JWT Authentication**:

   - Use **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for secure login and registration.
   - Ensure sensitive data (like JWT secret keys) is stored in environment variables and not hardcoded into the code.

3. **Limit IP Access**:

   - If possible, restrict API access to only specific IP addresses or networks using middleware in Node.js.

4. **Enable Rate Limiting**:

   - Use libraries like **express-rate-limit** to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     npm install express-rate-limit
     ```
     In your `server.js`:
     ```js
     const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
     const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
       windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
       max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
     });
     app.use("/api/", apiLimiter);
     ```

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Use a logging tool like **Winston** or **Morgan** to monitor requests and errors in production.

#### 6. **Maintain and Monitor the API**

When using your laptop as a server, you will need to monitor its uptime and performance, as it is less reliable than a cloud-hosted solution.

- **Keep your laptop running**: Ensure that it stays powered on and connected to the internet.
- **Use tools like PM2** to keep your Node.js app running even after you close the terminal:
  ```bash
  npm install pm2 -g
  pm2 start server.js
  ```

### Summary

1. **Develop the API** in Node.js and connect it to MSSQL.
2. **Configure your laptop’s firewall** and **port forwarding** to expose the API.
3. **Get your public IP** from your router or use a service like ngrok.
4. **Test the API** from an external device using the public IP.
5. **Secure the API** by using JWT, HTTPS (with ngrok or a reverse proxy), rate limiting, and logging.

By following these steps, you can make your API publicly accessible from your laptop without using any cloud services. However, keep in mind that this setup may not be as scalable or reliable as cloud solutions, so it’s suitable for small-scale or experimental projects.
